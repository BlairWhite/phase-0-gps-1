Prior to this session I still did not fully understand the process of pushing changes remotely. I also needed some help working inside of GitHub to fully utilize it.

Adell helped me to fully comprehend git workflow and operating inside of GitHub. He was able to do this by explaining in plain English what the point of all the steps is. He also helped me a lot with navigating inside of folders.

I asked Adell many questions about git workflow and navigating using the terminal.

Right now all my questions on git are answered. Adell was very helpful.

This GPS was very positive. I did not have a partner so Adell acted as my partner, which actually was incredibly helpful.
